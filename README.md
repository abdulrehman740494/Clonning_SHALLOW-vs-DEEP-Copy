# Clonning_SHALLOW-vs-DEEP-copy
<hr>
Repository contains Java programs (OOPs) demonstrating Cloning, Shallow Copy, and Deep Copy concepts. 
<br>
It explains how mutable and immutable objects behave in cloning , with clear examples using String, Integer, arrays, and custom classes.

<b><u>KEY CONCEPTS<u></b>

<b><u>Shallow Copy</u></b> – A copy where object references are shared. Any modification in one object reflects in the other if the field is mutable.

<b><u>Deep Copy</u></b> – A copy where a completely new object is created. Changes in one object do not affect the other.

<b><u>Mutable Objects</u></b> – Objects whose internal state can be modified (e.g., int[], ArrayList).

<b><u>Immutable Objects</u></b> – Objects whose state cannot be changed once created (e.g., String, Integer).
