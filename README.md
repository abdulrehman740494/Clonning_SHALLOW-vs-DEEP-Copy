# Clonning_SHALLOW-vs-DEEP-copy
Repository contains Java programs (OOPs) demonstrating Cloning, Shallow Copy, and Deep Copy concepts. 
<br>
It explains how mutable and immutable objects behave in cloning , with clear examples using String, Integer, arrays, and custom classes.

<b>ABOUT</b>

Shallow Copy – A copy where object references are shared. Any modification in one object reflects in the other if the field is mutable.

Deep Copy – A copy where a completely new object is created. Changes in one object do not affect the other.

Mutable Objects – Objects whose internal state can be modified (e.g., int[], ArrayList).

Immutable Objects – Objects whose state cannot be changed once created (e.g., String, Integer).
